# Circle Core - Audit & Testing Framework
*Last Updated: April 14, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines the audit and testing framework for the Circle Core project. It provides guidelines for testing teams to evaluate the security, functionality, and quality of the codebase. This framework ensures consistent testing approaches across all components and helps maintain the high standards required for a security-focused platform.

## Testing Tiers

### Tier 1: Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Tests for individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Tests for component interactions
- **Security Tests**: Tests focused on security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Tests**: Tests for system performance under load
- **Code Quality Checks**: Static analysis and linting

### Tier 2: Manual Testing
- **Functional Testing**: Validate features against requirements
- **Usability Testing**: Assess user experience and interface
- **Edge Case Testing**: Identify boundary conditions and exceptions
- **Documentation Review**: Verify documentation accuracy and completeness

### Tier 3: Security Auditing
- **Penetration Testing**: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: Manual security review of critical components
- **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential security threats
- **Compliance Checks**: Verify adherence to security standards

## Audit Process

### Pre-Audit Preparation
1. **Test Plan Creation**
   - Define test scope and objectives
   - Identify test cases and scenarios
   - Allocate resources and establish timeline

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Prepare test environments
   - Configure monitoring and logging
   - Deploy latest version of components

3. **Team Briefing**
   - Review architecture and components
   - Discuss known issues and focus areas
   - Assign testing responsibilities

### Audit Execution

1. **Automated Testing Phase**
   - Run full test suite (unit, integration, security)
   - Collect metrics and test reports
   - Identify any failing tests or coverage gaps

2. **Manual Testing Phase**
   - Execute manual test cases
   - Exploratory testing for edge cases
   - User experience evaluation

3. **Security Audit Phase**
   - Perform penetration testing
   - Conduct code reviews for security issues
   - Validate security controls and configurations

4. **Documentation Review**
   - Verify documentation accuracy
   - Ensure complete API documentation
   - Check for security guidance and best practices

### Post-Audit Activities

1. **Findings Documentation**
   - Categorize issues by severity and type
   - Document reproduction steps
   - Provide evidence and impact assessment

2. **Remediation Planning**
   - Prioritize issues for remediation
   - Assign responsibilities for fixes
   - Establish timelines for resolution

3. **Verification Testing**
   - Verify fixes for identified issues
   - Regression testing to ensure no new issues
   - Final report preparation
