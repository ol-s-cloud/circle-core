# [ADR-0001] Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

## Status

## Date

## Context

Circle Core needs a deployment strategy that supports a variety of environments (development, staging, production) while maintaining consistent security controls and configuration across all environments. We need to balance flexibility, security, and operational ease for teams deploying Circle Core components.

Key requirements include:
- Support for multiple deployment environments
- Consistent security controls
- Separation of configuration from application code
- Persistent storage management
- External access configuration
- Validation mechanisms for deployments
- Infrastructure-as-code approach for auditability and repeatability

Our engineering teams have varying levels of experience with container orchestration tools, and we need to choose an approach that balances power and usability.

## Decision

We will use Kubernetes as our primary deployment platform with the following architectural components:

1. **Kustomize for Environment Management**
   - Base templates for all resources
   - Environment-specific overlays (dev, staging, production)
   - Generated manifests for specific deployments

2. **Core Resource Types**
   - **ConfigMap**: For application configuration that is not sensitive
   - **Secret**: For sensitive configuration and credentials
   - **PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)**: For persistent storage
   - **Deployment**: For application containers with security contexts
   - **Service**: For internal networking
   - **Ingress**: For external access with TLS
   - **NetworkPolicy**: For network security

3. **Validation Framework**
   - Pre-deployment validation script for manifest correctness
   - Post-deployment validation for runtime verification
   - Multi-environment support in validation tools
   - Comprehensive reporting of validation results

4. **Security Controls**
   - Network policies with default-deny approach
   - Secret management with proper RBAC
   - Non-root container execution
   - Resource limits on all containers
   - ReadOnly filesystem where possible

5. **Deployment Tooling**
   - Deployment script with environment selection
   - Configuration generation for environment-specific settings
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Monitoring integration

## Alternatives Considered

- **Docker Compose**
  - Pros: Simpler to set up, lower learning curve
  - Cons: Limited scaling capabilities, fewer security controls, no built-in orchestration
  - Rejection Reason: Insufficient for production-grade deployments and lacks the security features required

- **Helm Charts**
  - Pros: Widely adopted, template-based approach, versioning
  - Cons: More complex templating, potential security issues with Tiller (Helm v2), steep learning curve
  - Rejection Reason: Kustomize offers a more GitOps-friendly approach with simpler overlays and easier customization

- **Cloud-specific Solutions (ECS, ACI, Cloud Run)**
  - Pros: Managed services with less operational overhead
  - Cons: Vendor lock-in, inconsistent features across providers
  - Rejection Reason: Need for multi-cloud and on-premises deployment options

- **Traditional VM-based Deployment**
  - Pros: Familiar to most teams, established tooling
  - Cons: Resource inefficiency, slower deployment cycles, more complex scaling
  - Rejection Reason: Container-based approach offers better resource utilization and deployment velocity

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent deployment approach across all environments
- Strong security controls with defense-in-depth
- Clear separation of configuration and application code
- Declarative infrastructure with version control
- Support for multiple cloud providers and on-premises deployments
- Scalability for growing workloads
- Detailed validation capabilities for deployment verification

### Negative

- Increased complexity compared to simpler solutions
- Learning curve for teams not familiar with Kubernetes
- Additional operational overhead for cluster management
- More detailed monitoring and observability requirements

### Neutral

- Need for documented deployment processes
- Regular security reviews of Kubernetes configurations
- Ongoing training for development and operations teams
