# Circle Core Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Circle Core project. These documents capture important architectural decisions, the context in which they were made, considered alternatives, and the implications of each decision.

## Purpose

- Document significant architectural decisions and their rationale
- Provide a historical record of how the architecture has evolved
- Ensure knowledge persistence beyond team transitions
- Create a reference for future decisions and development work
- Support onboarding of new team members

## ADR Structure

Each Architecture Decision Record follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: A descriptive title capturing the essence of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The forces at play and the problem being addressed
- **Decision**: The chosen approach and its details
- **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
- **Related Decisions**: Links to related ADRs
- **References**: Additional resources and background information

## ADR Index

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-0001](0001-kubernetes-deployment-architecture.md) | Kubernetes Deployment Architecture | Accepted | April 16, 2025 |
| [ADR-0002](0002-security-first-approach.md) | Security-First Architectural Approach | Accepted | March 10, 2025 |

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new Architecture Decision Record:

1. Create a new file named `####-title-in-kebab-case.md` where `####` is the next available number
2. Use the [ADR template](adr-template.md) as a starting point
3. Fill in all sections with detailed information
4. Submit the ADR for team review
5. Update the status based on the outcome of the review
6. Add the ADR to the index in this README

## ADR Lifecycle

ADRs follow a typical lifecycle:
1. **Proposed**: When an ADR is first created and submitted for review
2. **Accepted**: When an ADR has been approved and the decision is active
3. **Deprecated**: When an ADR is no longer relevant but hasn't been explicitly replaced
4. **Superseded**: When an ADR has been replaced by a newer decision (reference the new ADR)
