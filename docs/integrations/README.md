# Circle Core Integrations Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all integrations with the Circle Core framework. Each integration is categorized, tracked for status, and documented with technical details and implementation guidelines.

## Purpose

- Track all potential and implemented integrations
- Document integration specifications and requirements
- Provide implementation guides for developers
- Maintain a historical record of integration evolution
- Support strategic planning for the Circle Core ecosystem

## Document Structure

Each integration report follows a consistent format:
- Integration overview and purpose
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Implementation status and roadmap
- Security considerations
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting and FAQs

## Integration Status Tracking

Integration status is tracked using the following classifications:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ Complete | Integration fully implemented and tested |
| üöß In Progress | Integration currently in development |
| üîç Researching | Feasibility analysis and research phase |
| üìÖ Planned | Scheduled for future implementation |
| ‚ùå Not Started | Identified but not yet scheduled |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked | Implementation blocked by dependencies |
| üîÑ Maintenance | Integration implemented but undergoing updates |

## Historical Records

Historical snapshots of the integration status are preserved to track progress over time:

| Date | Milestone | Report |
|------|-----------|--------|
| [April 16, 2025](historical/2025-04-16-integrations.md) | Initial Integration Planning | Initial ecosystem mapping |
