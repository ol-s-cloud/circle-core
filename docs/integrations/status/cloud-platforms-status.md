### Other Cloud Platforms

The remaining cloud platforms (Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Digital Ocean, Tencent Cloud) are currently not started and planned for later releases. The priority order for implementation after the major three cloud providers is:

1. Digital Ocean (v0.4.0) - Due to simpler API and higher demand
2. Oracle Cloud and IBM Cloud (v0.5.0) - Enterprise customer requirements
3. Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud (v0.6.0) - International market expansion

## Risks and Challenges

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API differences between providers | Abstract through common interface pattern |
| Authentication complexity | Develop uniform credential management |
| Multi-region support variation | Create provider-specific region handling |
| Service availability differences | Feature flags for provider-specific capabilities |
| Integration testing complexity | Develop mocking framework for cloud services |

## Upcoming Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| AWS S3 Integration | May 15, 2025 | Complete AWS S3 storage provider |
| Azure Blob Integration | May 20, 2025 | Complete Azure Blob storage provider |
| GCS Integration | May 25, 2025 | Complete Google Cloud Storage provider |
| Multi-Cloud Storage | June 10, 2025 | Unified storage interface across providers |
| Cloud Release v0.3.0 | June 15, 2025 | Release of major cloud integrations |

## Dependencies

The cloud platform integrations have dependencies on:
- Storage service (Completed in v0.1.0)
- Authentication framework (Completed in v0.1.0)
- Kubernetes deployment (Completed in v0.2.0)
- Configuration management (Completed in v0.1.0)

All dependencies have been satisfied in previous releases.

## Implementation Approach

The cloud integration strategy follows a layered architecture approach:

1. **Abstraction Layer**
   - Common interfaces for storage, identity, compute, etc.
   - Provider-agnostic models and entities
   - Unified error handling and retry logic

2. **Provider-Specific Implementations**
   - AWS implementation of storage interface
   - Azure implementation of storage interface
   - GCP implementation of storage interface
   - Custom capabilities for each provider

3. **Feature Detection and Capability Management**
   - Runtime feature detection
   - Provider capability registry
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported features

4. **Configuration and Credential Management**
   - Unified credential management
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Secret rotation and management

## Testing Strategy

Cloud integrations require a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Mock-based testing of provider-specific code
- **Integration Tests**: Test against actual cloud providers (sandboxed environments)
- **Compatibility Tests**: Verify cross-provider compatibility
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark operations across providers
- **Security Tests**: Verify proper credential handling and security controls

Test accounts have been established in AWS, Azure, and GCP for development and testing purposes.

## Documentation Plan

Documentation will be developed in parallel with the implementations:

- Provider-specific setup guides
- Authentication configuration guides
- Storage operations handbook
- Multi-cloud strategy documentation
- Security best practices
- Cost optimization guidelines
