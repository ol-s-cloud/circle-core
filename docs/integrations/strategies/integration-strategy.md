## Integration Structure

Each integration follows this standard structure:

```
/circle_core
  /integrations
    /{category}
      /{provider}
        __init__.py        # Public interface
        client.py          # API client
        models.py          # Data models
        auth.py            # Authentication handling
        exceptions.py      # Provider-specific exceptions
        utils.py           # Utility functions
        config.py          # Configuration schema
    /common
      interfaces.py        # Common interfaces
      errors.py            # Common error types
      auth.py              # Authentication framework
      config.py            # Configuration framework
```

## Versioning & Compatibility

Integrations follow these versioning guidelines:

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes to interfaces
- **Minor Version (X.Y.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch Version (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes, no interface changes

Backward compatibility guarantees:
- Interfaces stable within major versions
- Deprecated features receive 1 major version support
- Configuration structure stable within minor versions
- Error types stable within minor versions

## Integration Quality Standards

All integrations must meet these quality standards:

| Aspect | Requirement |

| Security | Pass security review, no critical/high findings |
| Performance | Response time within defined SLAs |
| Error Handling | Proper error types, retry logic |
| Observability | Metrics, logging, tracing support |
| Configuration | Schema validation, sensible defaults |
