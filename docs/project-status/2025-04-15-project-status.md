## Next Priorities

Based on our [Gap Analysis](../../GAP_ANALYSIS.md), our immediate priorities are:

1. **Complete Infrastructure Components**
   - Finish deployment templates (final Sprint 2 task)
   - Create comprehensive examples for all components

2. **Begin Developer Experience Improvements**
   - Start CLI tool development
   - Expand documentation coverage
   - Create more comprehensive examples

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Enhance RBAC capabilities
   - Implement security compliance frameworks
   - Add threat intelligence integration

4. **Operational Capabilities**
   - Implement monitoring integrations
   - Create operational dashboards
   - Add observability features

## Key Challenges & Risks

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Maintaining security while adding complexity
   - Balancing flexibility with security controls
   - Ensuring backward compatibility
   - Performance optimization at scale

2. **Project Risks**
   - Documentation keeping pace with development
   - Maintaining test coverage as features increase
   - Resource constraints for specialized components
   - Time-to-market pressures

## Conclusion

The Circle Core Framework has made significant progress in establishing a robust security foundation and key infrastructure components. With the completion of the configuration management system, we've reached 94% completion of Sprint 2, with only deployment templates remaining. 

The configuration system provides a flexible, secure way to manage application configuration with support for multiple sources, validation, and environment-specific settings. It integrates with our security-first approach by providing validation and secure handling of sensitive configuration data.

Our focus is now shifting toward completing the final Sprint 2 task (deployment templates) and beginning the developer experience improvements planned for Sprint 3.
