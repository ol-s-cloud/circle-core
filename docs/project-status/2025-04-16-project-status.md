## Next Priorities

Based on our [Gap Analysis](../../GAP_ANALYSIS.md), our immediate priorities are:

1. **Developer Experience Improvements**
   - Start CLI tool development
   - Expand documentation coverage
   - Create comprehensive examples for all components
   - Design SDK architecture

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Enhance RBAC capabilities
   - Implement security compliance frameworks
   - Add threat intelligence integration

3. **Operational Capabilities**
   - Implement monitoring integrations
   - Create operational dashboards
   - Add observability features

4. **Documentation Structure**
   - Reorganize project documentation
   - Create deployment guides
   - Add Kubernetes deployment examples

## Key Challenges & Risks

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Maintaining security while adding complexity
   - Balancing flexibility with security controls
   - Ensuring backward compatibility
   - Performance optimization at scale

2. **Project Risks**
   - Documentation keeping pace with development
   - Maintaining test coverage as features increase
   - Resource constraints for specialized components
   - Time-to-market pressures

## Conclusion

The Circle Core Framework has successfully completed Sprint 2 with the addition of comprehensive Kubernetes deployment resources and validation capabilities. This marks the completion of all infrastructure components in our roadmap, allowing us to transition to Phase 3 focused on developer experience improvements.

The Kubernetes deployment implementation provides a full stack of resources including ConfigMap, Secret management, PVC for storage, and Ingress configurations, along with a sophisticated validation framework that supports multiple platforms and environments.

With the foundation of security and infrastructure components now in place, our focus shifts to improving the developer experience with CLI tools, expanded documentation, and SDK development in Sprint 3.
