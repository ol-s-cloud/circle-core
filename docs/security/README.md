## Security Model

The Circle Core Framework implements a comprehensive security model with multiple layers:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure user authentication with Argon2 password hashing
2. **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data protection
3. **Audit**: Tamper-evident logging with cryptographic hash chains
4. **Validation**: Package validation with signature verification
5. **Dependency Security**: Scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities
6. **Secrets Management**: Secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information
7. **Security Monitoring**: Real-time detection of security events
